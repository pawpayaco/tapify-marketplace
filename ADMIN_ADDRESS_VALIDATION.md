# ✅ Admin Address Validation Integration

## 🎯 **Changes Made**

### **1. Added Address Validation to Admin Edit Profile Modal**

The Edit Profile modal in the admin stores page now uses the same **Google Maps + USPS address validation** system as the public registration form.

#### **Features:**
- ✅ **Google Maps Autocomplete** - Type to search for addresses
- ✅ **USPS Verification** - Automatic validation when address is selected
- ✅ **Standardized Format** - Ensures addresses are deliverable and properly formatted
- ✅ **Visual Feedback** - Green checkmark for validated addresses, red error for invalid

### **2. Added Invalid Address Alerts on Dashboard**

Stores with incomplete or invalid addresses now show a **⚠️ warning icon** directly in the dashboard table.

#### **Warning Detection:**
The system checks for:
- Missing address data
- Addresses without street numbers
- Addresses without commas (indicating missing city/state)
- Addresses without state codes (2-letter format)
- Addresses without ZIP codes (5-digit format)

#### **Visual Indicator:**
- **Yellow warning badge** appears next to invalid addresses
- **Hover tooltip** explains the issue and prompts admin to verify
- **Non-intrusive** - doesn't block workflow, just alerts

## 🎨 **UI/UX Improvements**

### **Edit Profile Modal:**
- Replaced plain text input with `AddressInput` component
- Supports Google Maps autocomplete
- Auto-validates with USPS on selection
- Shows validation status (✓ Validated / ⚠️ Error)

### **Dashboard Table:**
- Small warning icon next to problematic addresses
- Tooltip: "⚠️ Address appears incomplete or invalid. Click Edit to verify with USPS."
- Doesn't affect table layout or scrolling

  const hasNumber = /\d/.test(address);
  const hasComma = /,/.test(address);
  const hasState = /\b[A-Z]{2}\b/.test(address);

}
```
