# Webhook Debugging Guide

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Webhook configured in Shopify
- ‚úÖ Product title includes "Priority Display"
- ‚úÖ `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Vercel
- ‚ùå Database not updating

## Step 1: Check Shopify Webhook Delivery Status

1. Go to Shopify Admin ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Click on your webhook (Order creation)
3. Click "Recent deliveries"
4. Find your test purchase
5. Check the status:

### Possible Results:

**‚úÖ 200 OK** = Webhook was received successfully
- If you see 200 OK but database isn't updating, the issue is:
  - Email mismatch between Shopify customer and retailer
  - Product title detection not working
  - Logic error in webhook code

**‚ùå 401 Unauthorized** = HMAC verification failed
- Secret is wrong or not deployed
- Check: Did you redeploy Vercel AFTER adding the secret?
- Try: Redeploy again from Vercel dashboard

**‚ùå 500 Internal Server Error** = Application error
- Check Vercel logs for the error
- Likely a code issue or database connection problem

## Step 2: Check Vercel Logs

### Via Vercel Dashboard:
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Open your project
3. Click **Logs** tab
4. Filter by `/api/shopify-webhook`
5. Look for recent entries around the time of your test purchase

### What to look for:
```
[shopify-webhook] Invalid HMAC signature  ‚Üê Secret issue
[shopify-webhook] Priority Display detected: true  ‚Üê Good!
[shopify-webhook] ‚úÖ Priority Display order processed for retailer: [id]  ‚Üê Success!
```

## Step 3: Verify Email Matching

The webhook matches by EMAIL. Run this SQL query:

```sql
-- Check what email was used in Shopify order
SELECT
  shopify_order_id,
  customer_email,
  is_priority_display,
  retailer_id,
  processed_at
FROM orders
ORDER BY processed_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

Then check if that email exists in retailers:

```sql
-- Check if retailer exists with that email
SELECT
  id,
  name,
  email,
  priority_display_active
FROM retailers
WHERE email = 'email-from-order-above@example.com';
```

### Common Issue:
- Shopify order email: `customer@gmail.com`
- Retailer email: `customer@different-email.com`
- **Result**: Webhook receives order, but can't find retailer to update

## Step 4: Check Product Title Detection

The webhook looks for these keywords (case-insensitive):
- "priority display"
- "priority placement"

Check your recent order in database:

```sql
SELECT
  shopify_order_id,
  product_name,
  is_priority_display,
  customer_email,
  retailer_id
FROM orders
ORDER BY processed_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

If `is_priority_display = false`, the product title didn't match.

## Step 5: Manual Database Test

To verify the dashboard UI works, manually set the flag:

```sql
UPDATE retailers
SET priority_display_active = true
WHERE email = 'your-test-email@example.com';
```

Then refresh the dashboard. Does it show "Priority Display Active üíé"?

- **Yes** = UI works, webhook is the issue
- **No** = UI issue, need to check dashboard code

## Step 6: Test with Fresh Order

If webhook is receiving 200 OK but not updating:

1. **Create new test retailer**:
   - Register with email: `webhook-test-2025@yourdomain.com`
   - Note the exact email used

2. **Purchase on Shopify**:
   - Use the EXACT SAME email: `webhook-test-2025@yourdomain.com`
   - Product: "Priority Display Upgrade"

3. **Check Vercel logs immediately**:
   - Look for `[shopify-webhook]` entries
   - Should see email, UID detection, etc.

4. **Check database**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM retailers WHERE email = 'webhook-test-2025@yourdomain.com';
   ```

## Step 7: Check Environment Variable Deployment

Sometimes Vercel doesn't pick up new environment variables. Verify:

1. Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Find `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
3. Check which environments it's assigned to:
   - ‚úÖ Production
   - ‚úÖ Preview
   - ‚úÖ Development

4. Check when it was added vs when you last deployed
5. If added AFTER last deployment ‚Üí Redeploy now

### Force Redeploy:
1. Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments
2. Find latest deployment
3. Click three dots (‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢)
4. Click "Redeploy"
5. Wait for deployment to complete
6. Try webhook again

## Common Causes (in order of frequency):

1. **Email mismatch** (80% of issues)
   - Customer uses different email on Shopify vs registration

2. **Secret not redeployed** (15% of issues)
   - Secret added to Vercel but not redeployed

3. **Product title mismatch** (3% of issues)
   - Title doesn't include "priority display" or "priority placement"

4. **Wrong column checked** (2% of issues)
   - Checking `express_shipping` instead of `priority_display_active`

## Next Steps

Please provide:
1. Screenshot of Shopify webhook "Recent deliveries" status
2. Email used for Shopify purchase
3. Email of retailer in database you're testing with
4. Result of this SQL query:
   ```sql
   SELECT
     shopify_order_id,
     customer_email,
     is_priority_display,
     retailer_id
   FROM orders
   ORDER BY processed_at DESC
   LIMIT 3;
   ```
