# ✅ Auto-Population Fix Complete

## 🎯 **Issue Fixed**

When replacing the regular address input with the Google Maps + USPS AddressInput component, the auto-population of fields when selecting a store from the dropdown was not working properly.

---

## ✅ **What Was Fixed**

### **1. Main Store Selection Auto-Population**

When a user selects an existing store from the dropdown, these fields now auto-populate:

- ✅ **Store Name** → `formData.storeName`
- ✅ **Owner Name** → `formData.ownerName`
- ✅ **Email** → `formData.email`
- ✅ **Phone** → `formData.phone`
- ✅ **Store Address** → `formData.storeAddress` (now updates AddressInput component)

**Handler:** `handleSelectRetailer()` (line 246)

### **2. Additional Store Selection Auto-Population**

When selecting an existing store for additional locations, these fields now auto-populate:

- ✅ **Store Name** → `store.storeName` (NEW - was missing)
- ✅ **Manager Name** → `store.managerName` (NEW - auto-fills from owner_name)
- ✅ **Store Address** → `store.address` (now updates AddressInput component)

**Handler:** `handleSelectAdditionalRetailer()` (line 82)

---

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### **1. AddressInput Component (`components/AddressInput.js`)**

Added a `useEffect` to watch for changes to the `value` prop:

```javascript
// Update internal query when value prop changes (for auto-population)
useEffect(() => {
  if (value !== query) {
    setQuery(value || '');
    // If we got a new value, consider it successful (from store selection)
    if (value && value.length > 0) {
      setSuccess(true);
      setError('');
    }
  }
}, [value]);
```

**What this does:**
- Listens for external updates to the address value
- Updates the internal input field display
- Shows success checkmark when address is auto-populated
- Clears any previous errors

### **2. Register Page (`pages/onboard/register.js`)**

Updated `handleSelectAdditionalRetailer` to also populate store name and manager name:

```javascript
const handleSelectAdditionalRetailer = (id, retailer) => {
  setAdditionalStores(prev => 
    prev.map(store => 
      store.id === id ? {
        ...store,
        selectedRetailer: retailer,
        storeQuery: retailer.name,
        storeName: retailer.name,                            // ← NEW
        address: retailer.address || retailer.location || '',
        managerName: retailer.owner_name || store.managerName, // ← NEW
        showSuggestions: false,
        storeSuggestions: []
      } : store
    )
  );
};
```
