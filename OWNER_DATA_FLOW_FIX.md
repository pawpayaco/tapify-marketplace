# ✅ Owner Data Flow - FIXED

## 🎯 **Problem**
Owner names and emails added by admin weren't showing up when retailers selected their pre-made account during registration.

---

## ✅ **Solution**

### **Root Cause:**
- Admin was storing owner info in `retailer_owners` table only
- Search API was only looking at `retailers` table
- No connection between the two

### **Fix Applied:**

#### **1. Search API (`/api/retailers/search.js`)**
- ✅ Added LEFT JOIN with `retailer_owners` table
- ✅ Returns owner_name, owner_email, owner_phone from admin-added data
- ✅ Flattens the joined data for easy use

#### **2. Add Owner API (`/api/admin/add-owner.js`)**
- ✅ Now updates `retailers` table directly with owner info
- ✅ ALSO stores in `retailer_owners` for relationship tracking
- ✅ Creates outreach tracking record
