# ✅ Stores Dashboard Error Fixed

## 🎯 **Problem**
The admin stores page was showing "Error Loading Stores" with the message:
```
column retailers.notes does not exist
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
The `StoresDataGrid` component was trying to select a `notes` column from the `retailers` table that doesn't exist in the database.

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### **1. Removed `notes` from Database Query**
```javascript
// Before (causing error)
.select('id, name, address, phone, email, owner_name, cold_email_sent, cold_email_sent_at, converted, converted_at, notes, created_at')

// After (fixed)
.select('id, name, address, phone, email, owner_name, cold_email_sent, cold_email_sent_at, converted, converted_at, created_at')
```

### **2. Removed `notes` from CSV Export**
```javascript
// Before
const headers = ['Name', 'Address', 'Phone', 'Email', 'Status', 'Email Sent', 'Notes'];

// After
const headers = ['Name', 'Address', 'Phone', 'Email', 'Status', 'Email Sent'];
```

### **3. Removed `notes` from Edit Profile Modal**
- Removed `notes` from form state
- Removed `notes` from form initialization
- Removed `notes` from database update
- Removed notes textarea from form UI

## 🎊 **Result**
The stores dashboard now loads properly without any database errors!

✅ **Stores list displays correctly**  
✅ **No more "column does not exist" error**  
✅ **CSV export works**  
✅ **Edit profile modal works**  

**Dashboard is fully functional again!** 🚀
