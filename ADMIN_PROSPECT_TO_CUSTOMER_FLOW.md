# ✅ Complete Admin Prospect → Customer Flow

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

The owner name and email added by admin weren't showing up when retailers selected their pre-made account during registration. This has been **completely fixed** by properly wiring the database relationships.

---

## 🔄 **Complete Flow (How It Works)**

### **Step 1: Admin Creates Prospect**
*Admin Stores Page → Add Prospect or Add Owner Info*

```
Admin Action:
1. Goes to Admin → Stores
2. Clicks "Add Prospect" or "📧 Add Owner"
3. Enters:
   - Store Name: "Starbucks Coffee"
   - Address: "123 Main St, San Francisco, CA"
   - Owner Name: "John Smith"
   - Owner Email: "john@starbucks.com"
   - Owner Phone: "(555) 123-4567"
4. Clicks "Add"

↓ Backend Processing ↓

Database Updates (via /api/admin/add-owner):
1. ✅ Updates `retailers` table:
   - name: "Starbucks Coffee"
   - address: "123 Main St, San Francisco, CA"
   - owner_name: "John Smith"  ← NEW
   - email: "john@starbucks.com"  ← NEW
   - phone: "(555) 123-4567"  ← NEW

2. ✅ Inserts into `retailer_owners` table:
   - retailer_id: 123
   - owner_name: "John Smith"
   - owner_email: "john@starbucks.com"
   - owner_phone: "(555) 123-4567"
   - collected_by: 'admin'
   - collected_at: now()

3. ✅ Creates tracking in `retailer_outreach`:
   - retailer_id: 123
   - campaign: 'admin-added'
   - registered: false  ← Not registered yet
   - notes: "Admin added owner: john@starbucks.com"

Result: Prospect account is pre-made and ready for registration ✓

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **1. Search API (`/api/retailers/search.js`)**

**Before:**
```javascript
// Only searched retailers table
.select('id, name, address, email, phone')
```

**After:**
```javascript
// LEFT JOINs with retailer_owners to get admin-added owner info
.select(`
  id, name, address, location, email, phone, store_phone,
  retailer_owners!left (
    owner_name,
    owner_email,
    owner_phone
  )
`)

// Flattens the data for easy use
const results = data.map(retailer => {
  const ownerData = retailer.retailer_owners?.[0] || {};
  return {
    ...retailer,
    owner_name: ownerData.owner_name || '',
    email: ownerData.owner_email || retailer.email,
    phone: ownerData.owner_phone || retailer.phone
  };
});
```

**Result:** Owner info from `retailer_owners` table now appears in search results! ✅

---

### **2. Add Owner API (`/api/admin/add-owner.js`)**

**Before:**
```javascript
// Only inserted into retailer_owners table
await supabase
  .from('retailer_owners')
  .upsert({ retailer_id, owner_email, owner_name });
```

**After:**
```javascript
// 1. Updates retailers table directly
await supabase
  .from('retailers')
  .update({
    owner_name: owner_name,
    email: owner_email,
    phone: owner_phone
  })
  .eq('id', retailer_id);

// 2. ALSO inserts into retailer_owners table (for relationship tracking)
await supabase
  .from('retailer_owners')
  .upsert({ retailer_id, owner_email, owner_name });
```

**Result:** Owner info stored in BOTH places for redundancy and easy access! ✅
