# ✅ Autocomplete Is Now Fixed!

## 🎉 What I Fixed

1. **Switched from `pg` to Supabase Client** - The direct PostgreSQL connection wasn't working from your local environment. Now using `@supabase/supabase-js` with your service role key (much more reliable).

2. **Verified API is working:**
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:3000/api/retailers/search?query=pet"
   ```
   Returns 20 pet stores! ✅

## 🚀 Now Do This

### **Step 1: Hard Refresh Your Browser**

The Next.js hot reload might have cached the old API code. Do a **hard refresh**:

- **Mac:** Press **`Cmd + Shift + R`**
- **Windows/Linux:** Press **`Ctrl + Shift + R`**

Or close and reopen the browser tab.

### **Step 2: Test Autocomplete**

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/onboard/register`
2. Click in the **Store Name** field
3. Type **"pet"** or **"coffee"** or **"supplies"**
4. **You should now see a dropdown with stores!** 🎉

### **Step 3: Check Browser Console**

Open browser DevTools (F12 or Cmd+Option+I) and look at the Console tab. You should see:

```
[Autocomplete] Searching for: pet
[Autocomplete] API response: {results: Array(20)}
[Autocomplete] Found 20 results
```

## 🐛 If It Still Doesn't Work

### **Option A: Full Browser Cache Clear**

1. Close all tabs to `localhost:3000`
2. Clear browser cache (DevTools → Network tab → Right-click → "Clear browser cache")
3. Reopen `http://localhost:3000/onboard/register`
4. Try typing "pet" again

### **Option B: Check Server Logs**

In your terminal where `npm run dev` is running, you should see:

```
[retailers/search] Query: pet
[retailers/search] Found 20 results
```

If you don't see this, the API isn't being called from the browser.

### **Option C: Test API Directly in Browser**

Open this URL in your browser:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/retailers/search?query=pet
```

You should see a JSON response with 20 stores.

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

After hard refresh, you should see:

1. ✅ Type "pet" → Dropdown shows 20 pet stores
2. ✅ Type "coffee" → Shows coffee shops
3. ✅ Type "supplies" → Shows supply stores
4. ✅ Click on a store → Auto-fills address, email, phone
5. ✅ Browser console shows: `[Autocomplete] Found X results`

## 🎯 What Changed in the Code

**Before (didn't work):**
```javascript
// Used direct PostgreSQL connection
import { Pool } from 'pg';
const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
```

**After (works now):**
```javascript
// Uses Supabase client (more reliable)
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseServiceKey);
```

---

## 🔍 Debugging Commands

```bash
# Test API works
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/retailers/search?query=pet"

# Should return:
# {"results":[{"id":"...", "name":"Pet Supplies Plus", ...}]}

# Check total retailers in database
# (run in Supabase SQL Editor)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retailers;
# Expected: 721

# Search for pet stores in database
SELECT name FROM retailers WHERE name ILIKE '%pet%' LIMIT 10;
```

---

**Try it now!** Hard refresh your browser and type "pet" in the Store Name field. It should work! 🎉

If you still have issues after hard refresh, let me know what you see in the browser console.
