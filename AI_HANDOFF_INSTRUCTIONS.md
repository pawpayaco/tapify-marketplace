---

## üöÄ HOW TO USE THESE WITH YOUR AI CODER

### Option 1: Claude Code (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Copy your Shopify repo to local machine
cd ~/shopify-repo

# 2. Copy these briefing documents into the repo
cp ~/tapify-marketplace/SHOPIFY_AI_BRIEF.md .
cp ~/tapify-marketplace/SHOPIFY_QUICK_START.md .
cp ~/tapify-marketplace/SHOPIFY_INTEGRATION_DIAGRAMS.md .

# 3. Start Claude Code session
claude-code

# 4. Give initial prompt:
"Read SHOPIFY_AI_BRIEF.md and SHOPIFY_QUICK_START.md.
Your mission is to fix the Shopify integration so orders sync
to Supabase correctly. Start with Phase 1 tasks."
```

---

### Option 2: Cursor / GitHub Copilot
```
1. Open Shopify repo in Cursor
2. Add these 3 files to the repo root
3. Open SHOPIFY_AI_BRIEF.md
4. Use Cmd+K and say:
   "Read this document and implement the webhook handler
   according to the specifications in Integration Point 2"
```

---

### Option 3: ChatGPT / Claude (Web)
```
1. Copy entire contents of SHOPIFY_AI_BRIEF.md
2. Start new chat session
3. Paste document and say:
   "I need you to act as my Shopify integration engineer.
   Read this briefing document, then help me implement
   the webhook handler in pages/api/shopify-webhook.js"

4. For specific issues, paste relevant sections from
   SHOPIFY_INTEGRATION_DIAGRAMS.md (e.g., debugging flowcharts)
```

---

## üìã RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Give Context (30 minutes)
```
1. AI reads SHOPIFY_AI_BRIEF.md (full context)
2. AI reads SHOPIFY_QUICK_START.md (action plan)
3. AI explores Shopify theme files
4. AI explores Next.js repo (pages/api/ directory)
```

**You ask:** "What files need to be created or modified?"

**AI should identify:**
- pages/api/shopify-webhook.js (create or fix)
- Shopify theme.liquid (add attribution JS)
- .env.local (add SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET)
- Shopify webhook configuration (via admin)

---

### Phase 2: Implementation (2-4 hours)
```
Task 1: Implement webhook handler
  ‚Üí AI creates/fixes pages/api/shopify-webhook.js
  ‚Üí You verify HMAC validation logic
  ‚Üí You add SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET to .env.local

Task 2: Fix attribution capture
  ‚Üí AI adds JavaScript to Shopify theme.liquid
  ‚Üí You deploy theme changes to Shopify
  ‚Üí You test with ?ref=TEST123 parameter

Task 3: Configure webhook
  ‚Üí You go to Shopify Admin ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí Webhooks
  ‚Üí You create webhook for orders/create
  ‚Üí You copy webhook secret, add to .env.local
  ‚Üí AI verifies webhook configuration
```

---

### Phase 3: Testing (1-2 hours)
```
1. Set up ngrok for local testing
   ‚Üí npm run dev
   ‚Üí ngrok http 3000
   ‚Üí Update Shopify webhook URL to ngrok URL

2. Run attribution flow test
   ‚Üí Visit /t?u=TEST123 (after creating test UID)
   ‚Üí Verify redirect to Shopify with ref
   ‚Üí Check cart.json for attributes

3. Trigger test webhook
   ‚Üí shopify webhook trigger orders/create
   ‚Üí Verify 200 OK response
   ‚Üí Check Supabase for new order row

4. End-to-end test
   ‚Üí Real NFC tap (or simulate with URL)
   ‚Üí Complete actual test checkout
   ‚Üí Verify order + payout job created
```

---

### Phase 4: Verification (30 minutes)
```
AI runs through verification checklist from SHOPIFY_QUICK_START.md:

‚úÖ Attribution flow works
‚úÖ Webhook processes successfully
‚úÖ Orders sync to Supabase
‚úÖ Payout jobs created
‚úÖ retailer_id populated correctly
‚úÖ Commission splits calculated
‚úÖ Works on mobile device
```

---

## üéØ WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

**Before (Broken):**
```
Customer taps NFC ‚Üí Shopify checkout ‚Üí Order completes
‚ùå Order not in Supabase
‚ùå No payout job created
‚ùå Retailer can't get paid
```

**After (Fixed):**
```
Customer taps NFC ‚Üí Shopify checkout ‚Üí Order completes
‚úÖ Webhook fires within 1 second
‚úÖ Order synced to Supabase
‚úÖ Payout job created with retailer_id
‚úÖ Retailer sees pending commission in dashboard
‚úÖ Admin can process payout via Dwolla
```

---

## üÜò IF THE AI GETS STUCK

### Common Sticking Points & Solutions

**1. "I can't access your Shopify store"**
```
‚Üí AI doesn't need direct access
‚Üí It should generate code for you to deploy
‚Üí You deploy theme changes via Shopify admin
‚Üí You configure webhooks manually
```

**2. "I need the SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET"**
```
‚Üí Go to Shopify Admin ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí Webhooks
‚Üí Create webhook for orders/create
‚Üí Copy the webhook signing secret
‚Üí Give to AI to add to .env.local
```

**3. "How do I test without a real NFC tag?"**
```
‚Üí Create test UID in Supabase manually:
   INSERT INTO uids (uid, is_claimed, affiliate_url)
   VALUES ('TEST123', true, 'https://pawpayaco.com?ref=TEST123');

‚Üí Visit http://localhost:3000/t?u=TEST123 in browser
‚Üí Should redirect to Shopify with ref parameter
```

**4. "Database schema doesn't match documentation"**
```
‚Üí Your database recently underwent migration (Oct 2025)
‚Üí Refer to context/CLAUDE.md for migration notes
‚Üí Use context/supabase/tables_and_columns.md for current schema
‚Üí Key change: retailer_owners deprecated, data now in retailers
```

## üé¨ EXAMPLE PROMPTS TO USE

### Initial Prompt
```
I need you to fix the Shopify integration for my Tapify marketplace.

Read these documents:
1. SHOPIFY_AI_BRIEF.md (complete context)
2. SHOPIFY_QUICK_START.md (action plan)

Your goal: Make orders sync from Shopify to Supabase via webhooks,
with proper retailer attribution for commission tracking.

Start by analyzing the current state of pages/api/shopify-webhook.js
and identify what's broken or missing.
```

---

### Debugging Prompt
```
Orders are syncing to Supabase, but retailer_id is always null.

Refer to SHOPIFY_INTEGRATION_DIAGRAMS.md "Scenario 3: Missing Attribution"
and the debugging flowchart for "Attribution Not Working".

Walk me through the diagnosis steps to find where attribution is failing.
```

---

### Implementation Prompt

Implement the webhook handler according to Integration Point 2
in SHOPIFY_AI_BRIEF.md.

Requirements:
- HMAC validation using crypto.timingSafeEqual()
- Extract ref from note_attributes
- Lookup retailer from uids table
- Insert into orders table
- Create payout_job
- Update scans table
- Always return 200 OK

Show me the complete implementation.
```
