**TAPIFY INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM v2.0** updated


Pawpaya - Oscar’s custom dog collar brand and the internal proof-of-concept product line used to validate Tapify. Operates as the Trojan Horse for Phase 1.

Tapify - The overarching platform, infrastructure, and SaaS system that merges DTC and retail through NFC displays and multi-party payouts.

Vendor - Independent creator or brand (often Etsy/Shopify-based) that lists products on Tapify. Vendors ship directly to customers after Tapify manages display distribution.

Retailer - Physical store that hosts Tapify displays. Earns a commission for each sale originating from its in-store display.

Sourcing Agent (Ecom Kid) - Individual or affiliate responsible for recruiting new vendors or retailers to the Tapify network. In future phases, this becomes a gamified growth channel.

Display	- NFC/QR-powered in-store fixture produced by Tapify. It contains vendor sample products and directs customers to the vendor’s online listing for purchase.

UID - A unique NFC identifier assigned to each display. Used to track scans, sales, and payouts to the correct retailer.

Payout Job - A transaction record in Supabase that determines how each sale’s revenue is split among Vendor, Retailer, Sourcing Agent, and Tapify.



NOTES THAT ARE SUPER IMPORTANT:

🧭 Core Vision and Strategy

This project is a fluid, profit-driven software and commerce system designed to generate maximum income as rapidly as possible.
The system is being built with a dual-phase approach:

⚙️ Phase 1 – Trojan Horse (Internal Launch)

The software is initially being developed and deployed for internal use under the Pawpaya brand, focusing exclusively on selling Pawpaya’s pet products. This will last until we scale the brand up to many stores and create relationships with retailers.

🎯 Primary Goal

Use Pawpaya products as a Trojan Horse to:

Establish retailer relationships

Validate in-store conversion mechanics

Test the affiliate payout infrastructure

💰 Economic Model (Current)

Revenue is shared only between Pawpaya and the retailer — no vendor or sourcer commissions are active during this phase.

🧠 Tech Stack

Built using the Next.js + Supabase + Shopify ecosystem, integrated with NFC and QR-based tracking for affiliate attribution.

🌀 Funnel Optimization

Every step of the experience is engineered for maximum conversion efficiency, especially for onboarding franchise managers and owners.

🛒 Shopify System

The Pawpaya Shopify store currently serves as the core transactional backend.

Continue using Pawpaya’s Shopify backend as the parent marketplace as we scale from pawpaya brand into the full platform

🌍 Phase 2 – Marketplace and Platform Expansion

After validating the system through Pawpaya’s displays, the platform will open up to independent creators and brands—specifically targeting Etsy-style handmade or niche vendors.

🏪 Vendor Functionality

Each vendor will:

Have their own collection page or storefront within the Shopify ecosystem.

Be able to list products on the Tapify marketplace (the overarching platform).

Ship direct-to-consumer (DTC) orders after customers purchase via in-store QR/NFC display scans.

📦 Tapify’s Full-Service Vendor Package

Tapify (the parent company) will provide vendors with:

Custom display creation and printing

3D-rendered previews of what their retail displays will look like

Distribution management for onboarding into retail networks

🧩 Core Concept

“Amazon meets Etsy for physical retail” — bridging handmade, creator-driven products to brick-and-mortar stores.

🏪 Retailer Value Proposition

Retailers receive free, inventory-free displays that allow them to earn passive income through commissions on every sale originating from their in-store displays.

💎 Key Retailer Benefits

No inventory or risk: Displays only contain sample products; all sales are fulfilled online.

Free entry: Displays ship at no cost, with optional priority shipping upsells for faster delivery.

Custom branded displays: Each display is visually tailored per product, made from high-quality cardboard with Pawpaya’s super cute design language.

NFC + QR technology: Each display includes embedded NFC chips and scannable QR codes that instantly open the purchase link on the customer’s phone.

This creates a no-brainer offer for retailers — minimal effort, zero overhead, and a passive revenue stream.

🧵 Vendor Experience and Product Flow

In the expanded marketplace:

Vendors (Etsy-style creators) ship a few sample products to Tapify for display use.

Tapify distributes these samples across multiple retail locations as visual showcases.

Shoppers in stores see and interact with the handmade products, then scan/tap to order their own version online.

🪞 Example Use Case

A display may feature:

Custom resin pet tags

Handmade dog collars

Unique pottery items

Each product may differ slightly in color, name, or design—showcasing individuality and charm.
When a customer taps or scans the display, they are redirected to the vendor’s product listing, where they can order a personalized version online.

🚧 Current Stage: Pawpaya Rollout

The immediate milestone is completing the Pawpaya-tailored version of the Tapify platform, including:

Onboarding flows

Retailer incentive logic

NFC claim + attribution systems

Internal admin dashboards for tracking signups & payouts

Once this version is fully operational, the next phase will involve mass cold outreach to Pet Supplies Plus franchises nationwide.

☎️ Retailer Acquisition System

Tapify has already used the Google Maps API to scrape and compile approximately 750 Pet Supplies Plus franchise locations across the U.S., complete with phone numbers and metadata.

The sales process relies on manager-led conversion funnels to bypass ownership privacy barriers.

🧩 Funnel Steps
1. Cold Call Phase

Oscar calls the store and asks for the manager.

2. Manager Funnel

The manager is directed to pawpayaco.com, which functions as a custom landing page for franchise managers.

3. Incentive Structure

Managers are incentivized to share the Pawpaya display offer with the franchise owner:

If the owner successfully registers,
→ the manager earns a free friendship collar or gift card reward.

4. Privacy & Access Constraints

Because store managers cannot share owner contact info, this structure turns them into motivated intermediaries who deliver Tapify’s pitch on Oscar’s behalf.

5. One-Click Referral Mechanism

The landing page includes a Share API integration, enabling the manager to send a pre-filled message to their franchise owner in one tap — containing all relevant details, links, and visuals.

This design leverages social and incentive-driven psychology to convert franchise owners at scale—even without direct access to their contact information.

🔁 Summary of the Business Flywheel
Stage	Description
1. Pawpaya Products	Serve as the Trojan Horse proof-of-concept for the Tapify system.
2. Retail Displays	Create viral, in-store discovery moments that generate affiliate commissions.
3. Retailer Network	Scaled through cold calling + incentive-based referral funnels.
4. Platform Launch	Opens the Tapify ecosystem to third-party Etsy-style vendors.
5. Display-as-a-Service	Tapify manufactures and supplies branded, NFC-enabled displays to vendors.
6. Infinite Engine	Every display drives new sales, analytics data, and vendor adoption — creating a self-reinforcing growth loop.

✅ In short:
Pawpaya is the Trojan Horse that proves the system, builds retailer trust, and generates early cashflow.
Tapify is the platform evolution that scales it into a self-reinforcing marketplace — uniting creators, retailers, and data under one monetizable engine.

It is totally possible that there are some broken systems or code in my current repo that does not reflect my goals in this game plan main MD. there are also a lot of md files that could be old or unreliable that cursor has generate in the past. They might be super important though. Not sure. 

Every single md file in the context file is fully current and made by me

✅ Core Objectives

Merge DTC and retail through NFC-powered displays

Provide real-time affiliate tracking and analytics

Enable Etsy/Shopify creators to expand into physical retail

Automate payouts via Plaid/Dwolla ACH integration

Integrate tools and logistics to lock in the Tapify ecosystem

---

## 🌐 Frontend
- Each collection page links to affiliate-based checkout
- `/t?u=<UID>` route for NFC redirects → links to affiliate landing

---

## 🔗 NFC / UID Redirection
- UID (NFC) triggers redirect via `/t?u=<UID>`
- Supabase checks if UID is claimed → if not then it opens the claims page and the retailer can select their store and it registers to them and the following taps on the display are tracked to the retailers affiliate link so they earn the commission from the in store sales
- UID maps to `business_id`, cached affiliate URL

NFC / UID Redirection Flow

A customer taps an NFC tag or scans a QR code on a retail display.

The browser loads /t?u=<UID> which checks Supabase to see if the UID has been claimed.

If unclaimed:

Redirect to /claim, where the retailer can register and link the UID to their store.

Future scans will credit that store’s affiliate account.

If claimed:

Redirect instantly to the retailer’s custom affiliate link (Shopify collection or product).

Purpose: Enable automatic affiliate attribution for in-store sales while keeping friction near zero.

---

## 🧾 Vendor Intake Form (Etsy/Shopify)
**URL:** `/onboard`

- Fields: Name, Email, Store Type, Website URL, Shopify/Etsy Link, Fulfillment Speed, Inventory Cap, Upload Product Photos, Collection Name
- Optional: “Sourcing Agent” attribution field (to credit sourcing agent recruitment)
- On submit: Save to Supabase `vendors` table, trigger admin review

- these tables and data wire directly to Shopify + Supabase + etc 

---

## 💳 PAYOUTS (PLAID/DWOLLA)
- Backend includes pre-wired structure for **Plaid** ACH integration (plug-and-play)
- **Dwolla** wired for real embedded ACH payouts to sources retailers and vendors from my business bank account. Each entity gets a percentage cut that I can change and I keep a percentage as well. All sales on the displays are made through my shopify

### Stakeholders
- 🛒 Vendor (Etsy/Shopify maker)
- 🏪 Retailer (store hosting display)
- 🔍 Ecom Kid AKA sourcing agent - vise versa
- 🧠 Tapify (your cut)

### Infrastructure
- Each sale creates a `payout_job` with amount + % split
- Admin sets commission presets globally or per vendor
- All cuts auto-routed via Dwolla payouts (daily/weekly)
- Supabase tables:
  - `payout_jobs`
  - `vendor_accounts`
  - `retailer_accounts`
  - `sourcer_accounts`

### Variables per payout
- Vendor cut (e.g. 50%)
- Retailer cut (e.g. 20%)
- Sourcing agent cut (e.g. 10%)
- Tapify cut (leftover)

### Failsafes
- Retry failed payouts (bank issues, limit errors)
- Full payout history tracked by user in dashboard

---

## 🧠 Shopify Data Sync
- Each vendor can optionally connect Shopify store
- Each collection = Shopify Collection ID
- Use webhook or polling to track:
  - Orders
  - Inventory (alerts if stock too low)
- Match Shopify `line_item.product.collection` → `vendor`
- Affiliate tracking via Shopify UTM or checkout extensions
- Shopify data will feed directly into admin dashboard analytics

🧨 Growth & Cold Outreach System

Tapify’s initial rollout leverages Pawpaya-branded displays as the entry point into retail networks.

Cold Call Process:

Use Google Maps API to compile ~750 Pet Supplies Plus franchise locations (with phone numbers).

Call each store, request the manager.

Direct them to pawpayaco.com, a custom landing page designed to convert managers into franchise advocates.

Incentivize the manager with a free Pawpaya collar or gift card if the owner registers a display.

Use the Web Share API for a one-click “Send to Owner” button prefilled with all relevant info.

This structure turns managers into conversion catalysts without violating privacy barriers around franchise owner contact details.

---


🌍 Public Retailer Marketplace

A central hub for stores to discover and claim new product displays.

Key Features:

Browse vendor displays by:

Product type

Commission margins

Social proof / engagement metrics

One-click “Claim Display” button auto-registers retailer

NFC card shipped to store upon claim

Option for display auto-rotation (refresh with new vendors periodically)

---

🧭 Operating Philosophy

Tapify operates on three guiding principles:

Proof → Platform: Start small with a profitable internal brand, then scale to a universal SaaS system.

Delight → Distribution: Lead with emotional, aesthetic, and experiential value (like Pawpaya’s cuteness) to win adoption and loyalty.

Automation → Scale: Replace every manual process (calls, payouts, tracking) with software-driven systems to create a perpetually expanding ecosystem.

---

🏭 Fulfillment & Display Logistics

Tapify’s operational structure separates display distribution from customer fulfillment:

Tapify is responsible for printing, packaging, and shipping the physical in-store displays to retailers.

Vendors provide only the sample products that appear on those displays. These items are not sold in-store—they serve purely as tactile and visual examples of what customers can order online.

When a customer scans or taps the display and places an order, the vendor ships the final, customized product directly to the customer (DTC fulfillment).

This ensures Tapify manages all logistics for display rollout, while vendors maintain flexibility and control over how their products are produced and shipped.

💸 Payout Activation Rules

Multi-party payouts (Vendor / Retailer / Sourcing Agent / Tapify) become active only once third-party vendors onboard the platform.

Phase 1 (Pawpaya-only stage): Payouts involve only Pawpaya and the Retailer.

Phase 2 (Platform expansion): Once external vendors join, Tapify automatically enables the four-way payout system through Dwolla ACH, distributing commissions among all participants according to preset percentages.

🛒 Checkout Flow by Phase

To maintain a seamless transition across growth phases:

Phase 1:
All transactions are processed through the Pawpaya Shopify checkout.
Pawpaya is both the brand and merchant of record.

Phase 2:
As Tapify opens to external vendors, checkout will continue to route through the Pawpaya Shopify backend, but each vendor will have their own managed section or collection within the store.
Vendors will be able to update listings, manage pricing, and view analytics for their section while Tapify handles overall payment routing and fulfillment tracking.

This allows Tapify to maintain one centralized payment infrastructure while vendors operate semi-independently inside it.

📞 Phase 1 Manual Acquisition → Self-Propagating Engine

During Phase 1, Oscar personally conducts manual outreach and cold-calling to onboard the first wave of retailers using Pawpaya displays as the Trojan Horse.
This creates the initial traction and credibility needed to prove the system.

Once traction and data validation are achieved, Tapify transitions into a self-propagating ecosystem where:

Retailers claim displays autonomously via the marketplace.

Vendors onboard themselves through the /onboard form.

Sourcing agents (Ecom Kids) recruit new participants through the affiliate structure.

This shift converts Tapify from a manually driven operation into a viral, self-reinforcing growth engine.

🕹️ Gamified Sourcing System (Future Feature)

Tapify plans to introduce a gamified sourcing system as part of future ecosystem tools.

Concept Overview:

Sourcing Agents (Ecom Kids) earn points, levels, and rewards for successfully recruiting new vendors or retailers.

Leaderboards, streaks, and reward tiers make participation exciting and competitive.

Integrated social-sharing and referral tracking leverage the same UID/NFC infrastructure used for product attribution.

This system will transform sourcing into a viral, community-driven growth channel—rewarding creativity, initiative, and consistent engagement.

💬 Final Notes

Tapify is engineered to become the operating system for physical-to-digital commerce, transforming how handmade and boutique brands reach retail consumers.

By anchoring the system in a successful real brand (Pawpaya), every feature of Tapify is born from real-world necessity—not theory.
This ensures each piece of infrastructure is profitable, tested, and ready to scale into a self-propagating retail engine that unites creators, retailers, and sourcing agents under one growth loop.
