## 🎯 **The Complete Flow**

### **Step 1: Admin Adds Prospect** (Admin Panel)

```javascript
Admin → Stores / Outreach → "Add Prospect" Button
```

**What Happens:**
1. Admin finds a potential store
2. Clicks "🏪 Add Prospect"
3. Fills out form with available info:
   - Store Name (required)
   - Address (optional)
   - Owner Name (optional)
   - Owner Email (optional)
   - Owner Phone (optional)
   - Store Phone (optional)
   - Store Website (optional)
   - Notes (optional)
4. Submits form

**Backend Creates:**
```sql
-- New retailer (NOT converted yet)
INSERT INTO retailers (
  name, address, email, owner_name, phone,
  source = 'admin-prospect',
  converted = FALSE  -- Key difference!
)

-- Optional owner record if email provided
INSERT INTO retailer_owners (
  retailer_id, owner_email, owner_name, owner_phone,
  collected_by = 'admin'
)

-- Outreach tracking
INSERT INTO retailer_outreach (
  retailer_id,
  campaign = 'admin-prospect',
  registered = FALSE  -- Not yet registered
)
```

**Status in Admin:**
- `converted`: ❌ False (shows as "Prospect")
- `cold_email_sent`: Can be marked by admin
- Appears in Store List with "Prospect" badge

---

### **Step 2: Prospect Receives Outreach** (Email/Call)

**Admin Actions:**
1. Admin can mark "cold email sent"
2. Admin can add notes
3. Admin can use "Add Owner" to update contact info

**Prospect Actions:**
- Receives email or call from admin
- Gets registration link: `https://yoursite.com/onboard/register`

---

### **Step 3: Prospect Visits Registration Page** (Public)

```javascript
Prospect → https://yoursite.com/onboard/register
```

**What Prospect Sees:**
1. **Store Name Field** - Starts typing their store name
2. **Autocomplete Appears** - Shows their store in dropdown
3. **Selects Their Store** - Clicks on it

**✨ Auto-Population Magic:**
```javascript
// Form auto-fills with prospect data from admin!
{
  storeName: "Bob's Coffee Shop",           // From admin
  ownerName: "Bob Smith",                   // From admin
  email: "bob@coffeeshop.com",             // From admin
  phone: "(555) 123-4567",                  // From admin
  storeAddress: "123 Main St, City, ST"    // From admin
}
```

4. **Prospect Fills Missing Fields:**
   - Creates a password
   - Confirms/updates info

5. **Adds Additional Locations (if needed):**
   - Franchise owners can search/add more stores
   - Each gets own address and optional manager name

6. **Submits Registration**

---

### **Step 4: Backend Processes Registration** (API)

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/onboard/register`

**What Happens:**
```javascript
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

// 1. Create Supabase auth user
CREATE USER WITH EMAIL & PASSWORD

// 2. Update main retailer (convert from prospect)
UPDATE retailers 
SET 
  converted = TRUE,
  converted_at = NOW(),
  onboarding_completed = TRUE,
  email = 'bob@coffeeshop.com',
  owner_name = 'Bob Smith'
WHERE id = [retailer_id]

// 3. Create/update owner record
INSERT INTO retailer_owners (...)
ON CONFLICT (retailer_id, owner_email) DO UPDATE

// 4. Mark outreach as registered
INSERT INTO retailer_outreach
SET registered = TRUE, registered_at = NOW()

// 5. Process additional stores (if any)
FOR EACH additional_store:
  - UPDATE/INSERT retailer
  - INSERT retailer_owners (links to same owner_email)
  - INSERT retailer_outreach
  - INSERT displays (one per location)

COMMIT;
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Auth user created
- ✅ Main retailer converted (prospect → customer)
- ✅ All locations linked to owner
- ✅ Displays requested for all locations
- ✅ Outreach marked as successful conversion

---

### **Step 5: Customer Logged In** (Dashboard)

**Prospect is now Customer:**
- ✅ Can log in to dashboard
- ✅ See all their locations
- ✅ Track displays & earnings
- ✅ Manage bank account (payouts aggregate from all locations)

**Status in Admin:**
- `converted`: ✅ True (shows as "Converted")
- `registered`: ✅ True
- Green badge in admin panel
- All locations visible and tracked

---
