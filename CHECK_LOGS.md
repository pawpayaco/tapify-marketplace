# 🔍 Need to See Terminal Logs

When you try to access `/admin`, what do you see in your **terminal** (where `npm run dev` is running)?

You should see logs like:
```
[Admin SSR] User check: { hasUser: false, userId: undefined, email: undefined, userError: ... }
```

**Please share:**
1. Everything starting with `[Admin SSR]` from your terminal
2. Any errors you see

This will tell us exactly why the server can't read your session!

## Meanwhile, Let me try a different fix...

The issue is Supabase v2 stores sessions in localStorage by default, which the server can't read.
