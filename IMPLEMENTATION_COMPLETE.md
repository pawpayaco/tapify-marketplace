## 🚀 How It Works

### Data Flow
```
1. User logs in → email stored in AuthContext
2. useEffect fetches retailer by email
3. Parallel queries fetch: scans, payout_jobs, uids, retailer_accounts
4. Stats calculated from real scan data
5. Weekly chart data aggregated by day
6. All tabs show real data
7. Toast notifications on user actions
```

### Key Functions
```javascript
fetchRetailerData()           → Loads all data on mount
calculateStatsFromScans()     → Calculates KPIs from scans
calculateWeeklyData()         → Creates 7-day chart data
handleExportPayouts()         → Exports payouts to CSV
showToast()                   → Displays notifications
```

## 🔧 Configuration Notes

### Retailer Lookup
Currently fetches retailer by:
```javascript
.eq('name', user.email)
```

**You may need to adjust this** depending on how you identify retailers in your `retailers` table. Possible alternatives:
- `.eq('contact_email', user.email)` if you have a contact_email field
- `.eq('id', user.id)` if user IDs match retailer IDs

### Sample Data
If you don't have data yet, manually insert some test rows:

```sql
-- Test scans
INSERT INTO scans (uid, clicked, converted, revenue, timestamp, location)
VALUES 
  ('ABC123', true, true, 25.00, now(), 'San Francisco'),
  ('ABC123', true, false, 0, now() - interval '1 day', 'Oakland');

-- Test payout job
INSERT INTO payout_jobs (retailer_id, retailer_cut, total_amount, status)
VALUES ('your-retailer-id', 50.00, 100.00, 'pending');

-- Test UID
INSERT INTO uids (uid, registered_at)
VALUES ('ABC123', now());
```

4. See `CORRECT_SCHEMA_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for code

### Additional Features

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Dashboard shows "Loading..." forever
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify user is logged in (`user.email` exists)
- Ensure `retailers` table has matching record

### Stats show all zeros
- Check if `scans` table has data
- Verify retailer ID matches in database
- Check browser console for query errors

### Tabs don't show data
- Verify tables exist in Supabase
- Check table permissions (RLS policies)
- Use Supabase dashboard to manually query tables

### Toast notifications don't appear
- Check browser console for React errors
- Ensure `AnimatePresence` is imported
